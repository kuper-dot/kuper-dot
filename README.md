## About Me
Hello. My name is **Anton**. I'm a Ukrainian national, that immigrated to the UK in 2023. 

During my childhood, my father sparked an interest in computers in me. Since then my interest did not die out, quite the contrary in fact. By now I decided that my future career would be in the IT sector.  

When I and my family just moved into the UK, I started Information Technology Course in Bridgend College where I done BTEC Levels 2 and 3. During the time in College, I was taken part in few CTFs against other local colleges as part of the [Cyber College Cymru](https://cybercollegecymru.co.uk/) program. I was also enrolled in the [Skills Excellence in Wales](https://inspiringskills.gov.wales/) competition for “IT Technician” discipline, where i won a gold medal. In November 2025 i was a competitor on national level with [World Skills UK](https://www.worldskillsuk.org/) in the same discipline. While I did not won any medals there, I was highly commended.

## What I Am Doing?
Currently I’m a first year student in [University of south Wales] doing computer science. My course includes modules such as: 
- Computer System Concepts
- Information Management, Assurance and Security
- Mathematical tools for Computation
- Professionalism and employability
- Programming

In my free time I enjoy tinkering with my home server. My home lab consists of a DIY NAS running [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-community-edition/) and a [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview) system on "old" HP EliteDesk that host everything else. I have spent quite some time trying to set-up various services like DNS server and SMB shares. Setting up a DNS has taught me a basics of networking, while SMB forced me to learn about Linux ACLs.

There I also have two different services hosted that can serve video content and e-books. I use those to access my personal digital library. The problem is that those files are stored on a NAS that I don’t keep powered all the time. Therefore I had to spent few evenings implementing an automated caching system – a system that would copy the content that I’m likely to access from NAS to local storage of the server. It is not by any means perfect (or good for that matter), but it works good enough for me.

## My Skills
As I mentioned in previous sections, I have my own home server that I spent some time on maintaining. I also took part in multiple IT support competitions; those competitions test my ability of performing administration of Linux and Windows based systems.

As a side effect of creating a home server, I picked up some networking skills along the way. While I won’t describe myself as proficient in network architecture, I will say that I know basics very well. ~~Or it might just be Danning-Kruger effect.~~

While I’m not a big fan of codding, I know few languages on a basic level, those include Phyton, C# and C++. I have written a few basic projects in those languages. I also have some very basic experience of managing SQL databases.

## My Hobbies
As a computer science student, mine area of interest revolves around computers. If it wasn’t obvious from how much I ranted about my home server, I’m spending quite a lot of time configuring it. Frankly, most of the time I’m just fixing it, as it seems that with every update, no matter how small it is, everything just breaks and I need to do it all over again.

When it comes to actual hobbies, I enjoy gaming in my free time. Not the competitive kind thou, as I find communities of those games to be toxic. If I would have to pick a favourite genre, that would be a simulator games. Yes, that means that I can stare how plane files on autopilot for hours. Yes, most of my friends find it weird. Nonetheless, I also play *proper* genres, like RPGs, platformers and PvE shooters to name a few. I also enjoy photography of any kind. Admittedly, I don’t do it too often, so I my shoots are mediocre at best
