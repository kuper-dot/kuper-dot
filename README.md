## About Me
Hello. My name is **Anton**. I'm a Ukrainian national, that immigrated to the UK in 2023. 

During my childhood, my father sparked an interest in computers in me. Since then my interest did not die out, quite the contrary in fact. By now I decided that my future career would be in the IT sector.  

When I and my family just moved into the UK, I started Information Technology Course in Bridgend College where I done BTEC Levels 2 and 3. During the time in College, I was taken part in few CTFs against other local colleges as part of the [Cyber College Cymru](https://cybercollegecymru.co.uk/) program. I was also enrolled in the [World Skills UK](https://www.worldskillsuk.org/) Wales competition for “IT Technician” discipline. I won a gold medal in it and was qualified for national level.
