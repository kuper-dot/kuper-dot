## About Me
Hello. My name is **Anton**. I'm a Ukrainian national, that immigrated to the UK in 2023. 

During my childhood, my father sparked an interest in computers in me. Since then my interest did not die out, quite the contrary in fact. By now I decided that my future career would be in the IT sector.  

When I and my family just moved into the UK, I started Information Technology Course in Bridgend College where I done BTEC Levels 2 and 3. During the time in College, I was taken part in few CTFs against other local colleges as part of the [Cyber College Cymru](https://cybercollegecymru.co.uk/) program. I was also enrolled in the [Skills Excellence in Wales](https://inspiringskills.gov.wales/) competition for “IT Technician” discipline, where i won a gold medal. In November 2025 i was a competitor on national level with [World Skills UK](https://www.worldskillsuk.org/) in the same discipline. While I did not won any medals there, I was highly commended.

## What I Am Doing?
Currently I’m a first year student in [University of south Wales] doing computer science. My course includes modules such as: 
- Computer System Concepts
- Information Management, Assurance and Security
- Mathematical tools for Computation
- Professionalism and employability
- Programming

In my free time I enjoy tinkering with my home server. My home lab consists of a TrueNAS machine and a proxmox system that host everything else. Using that setup I managed to learn quite a lot about Linux
